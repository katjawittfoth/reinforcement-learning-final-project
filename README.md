# Mountain Car Problem
#### Louise Y Lai and Gokul Krishna

This is our final project for the Reinforcement Learning class taken as an elective for the Master's in Data Science program at USF. 

The goal is simple: given a car in a 2D plane that is stuck between two 'mountains', we want to teach the computer how to reach the top of the hill and stop at the correct spot. We use a Q-learning reinforcement learning approach.

This problem was first described by Andrew Moore in his PhD thesis [Moore90].
